### Learning objectives
1. Define operational humanitarian leadership in terms of vision, strategy and implementation  
  
2. Explain that leadership comprises three elements:  
    - The individual leader  
    - The leadership team  
    - Organisational structures and procedures  
  
3. List the conditions under which leadership is most effective, and reflect on your own organisation’s progress in creating those conditions.

+++

In recent years the topic of humanitarian leadership has been the subject of increased attention.  

There has been a widely held view amongst humanitarian policy makers and practitioners that humanitarian responses are often poor or inadequate, and that ineffective leadership is frequently to blame.  

+++

ALNAP’s research, and this workbook, focus on how humanitarian leadership can be most effective and, in turn, positively impact humanitarian response.

### Defining operational humanitarian leadership?  
  
  
Operational humanitarian leadership is about being responsible for a specific humanitarian response – making decisions that affect the design and implementation of a country or regional programme.

+++

It’s not about ‘one-off’ decisions made on technical issues by HQ units, or about decisions regarding overall organisational policy and strategy. Instead, it is about the day-to-day decisions that operational leaders make, trying to deliver the most effective humanitarian response, on the ground.

### Does it match your experience?


+++

Operational humanitarian leadership is the function of providing a clear vision and objectives for the humanitarian response; building a consensus that brings aid workers together around that vision and objectives; and finding ways of collectively realising the vision for the benefit of the affected population, often in challenging and hostile environments.

---

This definition emphasises three things:
1.	The identification of a vision and objectives; 
2.	Building consensus about how to achieve that vision (strategy and planning); and 
3.	The successful implementation of the plan.

### Exercise 2.2

### Rethinking operational humanitarian leadership
  
In humanitarian work, there has been an assumption that these three functions of leadership – the creation of a vision, the design of a strategy and the implementation of this strategy – will be conducted by a single individual, i.e. the leader.  
  
This leader is usually accountable for the results of these actions and responsible for carrying them out. He/she is expected to create the vision and strategy and provide the energy and drive that ensures that implementation occurs.  
  
In reality, it is impossible for any individual to be responsible for all elements of leadership.
