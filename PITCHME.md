    - The individual leader  
    - The leadership team  
    - Organisational structures and procedures  
  
3. List the conditions under which leadership is most effective, and reflect on your own organisation’s progress in creating those conditions.

<br>
In recent years the topic of humanitarian leadership has been the subject of increased attention.      

<br>
<br>
<br>

     
There has been a widely held view amongst humanitarian policy makers and practitioners that humanitarian responses are often poor or inadequate, and that ineffective leadership is frequently to blame.  

+++

ALNAP’s research, and this workbook, focus on how humanitarian leadership can be most effective and, in turn, positively impact humanitarian response.

### Defining operational humanitarian leadership?  
  
<br>
<br>

Operational humanitarian leadership is about being responsible for a specific humanitarian response – making decisions that affect the design and implementation of a country or regional programme.

+++?color=linear-gradient(180deg, #00666B 50%, #00655B 50%)

It’s not about ‘one-off’ decisions made on technical issues by HQ units, or about decisions regarding overall organisational policy and strategy. 
<br>  
<br>  
Instead, it is about the day-to-day decisions that operational leaders make, trying to deliver the most effective humanitarian response, on the ground.

Does it match your experience?


+++

Operational humanitarian leadership is the function of providing a clear vision and objectives for the humanitarian response; building a consensus that brings aid workers together around that vision and objectives; and finding ways of collectively realising the vision for the benefit of the affected population, often in challenging and hostile environments.

---

### This definition emphasises 3 things:
<br>
1.	The identification of a vision and objectives; 
2.	Building consensus about how to achieve that vision (strategy and planning); and 
3.	The successful implementation of the plan.

### Rethinking operational humanitarian leadership

---  
In humanitarian work, there has been an assumption that these three functions of leadership – the creation of a vision, the design of a strategy and the implementation of this strategy – will be conducted by a single individual, i.e. the leader.  

---
This leader is usually accountable for the results of these actions and responsible for carrying them out. He/she is expected to create the vision and strategy and provide the energy and drive that ensures that implementation occurs.  

---
In reality, it is impossible for any individual to be responsible for all elements of leadership.
